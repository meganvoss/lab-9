This supports earlier ANOVA results indicating that fire severity does not vary significantly across vegetation classes."

Although the numerical differences were small, herbaceous vegetation types (e.g., shrub-steppe and forbland) tended to have slightly lower water deficits compared to forested types like “Closed Tree Canopy”.This may reflect differences in water use or microclimate among plant functional groups."

However, as the number of days burned increased, radial growth appeared to decline slightly, particularly in high-severity events.\n\n\nA linear smoothing line fitted to each severity class indicated a negative relationship between fire duration and growth, with the steepest decline occurring in high-severity fires. This suggests that longer burn durations may suppress vegetation recovery, especially in areas experiencing high-intensity burns."

While severity class was not a statistically significant predictor of recovery (P &gt; 0.05), both actual evapotranspiration (AET) and water deficit (DEF) were significant. Specifically, higher AET was associated with a slight decrease in the probability of recovery (β = −0.0029, P = 0.0018), and higher DEF was also negatively associated with recovery (β = −0.0023, P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that drier conditions may inhibit vegetation recovery following wildfire, regardless of fire severity."
